COCEMFECLM

COCEMFE in Castilla La Mancha is a non-gubernamental Organization, born in 1990 and declared as Public Utility in 2000, that represents to people with phisic and organic dissabilities.

They vindicate for human rights of people with disabilities to achieve full social, education and work integration, with a gender perspective to guarantee the equality of opportunities in society, throwing away all kind of barriers.


In this program, I helped women with disabilities teaching them a minimal technical knowledge for starting their own businesses.

For that, they learned about:
	- Internet basics,
	- blogging,
	- proffesional social networks,
	- collaboration tools,
	- and we closed the cycle creating a custom own blog.
